With the evolution of cloud computing and cloud-native technologies, more and more services, larger cluster sizes, and more complex applications make data centers bigger and bigger. TPOS, PUE and server density pose great challenges to the management level of data centers. 

The "Smarthaven" is an important part of IDC's open source management projects, using cloud native, big data, and AI technology. We want to share:
